	<h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>
	<p>My name is Matthew Santiago, in my family I am the middle child with a twin brother as well as an older brother and sister. My major is going to be information technology.</p>
	<h4><u>What I hope to learn from this course</u></h4>

	<h5><u>My Hobbies</u></h5>
	<p>I enjoy doing most things, I enjoy playing basketball in my free time as well as going out and enjoying nature with my friends. I enjoy traveling, I have always enjoyed seeing new places and experiencing new things. I like seeing new cities and enjoying the energy. Also, during the summer I picked up golf, I'm not very good at it but I find the game incredibly relaxing and I understand why so many people can play this game into their later ages. It goes hand in hand with being a golf caddy, I have worked as a caddy for a year now and my fascinating for golf has only increased. Watching and caddying for really good golfers helped my motivation to want to pick up the sport myself. I only started playing in the summer so my form is not great but I know this will be a game I'll be playing for a while.</p>
	<h5><u>Fun Fact</u></h5>
	<p>I actually have a twin brother, he goes to the University of Illinois in Champaign</p>
